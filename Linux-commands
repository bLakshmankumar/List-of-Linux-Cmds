Redirections in linux
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Output redirection    (The > & >> symbol used for Output redirection)
---------------------------

    ls -al > filename(where to redirect)  - this way we can redirect the output of a command (note -: don't use for same file for two directions bcs it'll override the file and existing data will be removed) 
    but if you wanna add more contant  in the same file without override we should use (>>) 

   example  echo hello great learner >> listener (this way we can redirect the file without override the existing data)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 2) Input Redirections     ( The < Symbol used for Input redirection)
 
      In Linux / windows everything treated as a file, eaither regular file or directory or Devices 
	  In File Descripters -: Every File has associated number called FD 
	  Whenever we  Execute a program/command on terminal 3 files are always open. They are 
                     
 	1) standard input (FD0)   2) standard Output (FD1)    3) standard Error (FD2) (these files are present whenever program is run)
     
Error redirection -: error redirection routing the errors to a specific file otherthan Display
-----------------

Examples -: i execute a command called  (telnet localhost ) - we get an error but i don't want to display that error on display, i just wanna display the error on specific error file. How?

 solution -:  talent localhost 2> myerrorfile
 
                      now we can verify with cat command (cat myerrorfile) the error output will move to this error file only 

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 LINUX WITH PIPE ( | ) Symbol  -: 
 -----------------------------------------
 
 The symbol "|" denotes pipe.
 Use pipes to run two commands consecutively.
 Helps in creating powerfull commands.     
 
 for ex i wanna see contant of last lines in a file how?   By using pipeline symbol to get required result
 
                  # cat filename | less or | pg or | more 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  LINUX WITH Grep Command -: Syntax (grep word name)
-----------------------------------------

when we execute a grep command it'll scan the file and present relevent result in a format we want.

grep command we are using for find the required words in file

examples for grep command -:
-------------------------------------
 i have a file with list of fruits o this file i wanna list only avocado fruits so how can i listout ?
 
 Syntax -:  cat filename | grep word          ( once we execute this command it'll print our desired result)
            cat fruits | grep -v avocado      ( it'll print all lines except avocado)   ( simply it'll skip the matching words)
	    grep -n  word filename            ( It'll print the word with line numbers)
            cat fruits | grep -i avocado      ( it'll print matching words of avocado)
            cat fruits | grep -c avocado      ( it'll print  count of matching words)
	    cat fruits | grep -n avocado      ( it'll print matching words with line numbers) 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 LINUX WITH sort Command -:  (Syntax sort filename)
 --------------------------------------
 sort command ( sort command we are using for print the result in alphabetical order)
 
            sort -r filename           - it'll print the result from last to first.
	    sort -n filename           - it'll sort the result numarically.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LINUX WITH AWKCommand -:  (Syntax-:  awk options 'selection _criteria {action }' input-file > output-file)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

awk                                     - awk allows the users to use variables, numeric functions, string functions, and logical operators.
-------
awk operations                          - first it'll scan the file line by line and spilts each input line into fields and compares input line/ fields to pattern, finally it performs the action on matched lines.

Options:  
-----------

       -f  program-file : Reads the AWK program source from the file program-file, instead of from the  first command line argument.
                                                   
       -F fs            : Use fs for the input field separator.

AWK COMMMANDS PATTERS	-:												   
-----------------------------------------													 
awk '{print}' file name                            - default syntax of awk command.
awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt               - Print the lines which match the given pattern. 								 
awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt                   - Splitting a Line Into Fields.
awk '{print NR,$0}' employee.txt                   - Use of NR built-in variables (Display Line Number)
awk '{print $1,$NF}' employee.txt                  - Use of NF built-in variables (Display Last Field)  
awk 'NR==3, NR==6 {print NR,$0}' employee.txt      - Another use of NR built-in variables (Display Line From 3 to 6) 
awk '{print NR "- " $1 }' Filename                 - To print the first item along with the row number(NR) separated with ” – “ from each line in that file
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SED COMMMANDS PATTERS	-:

sed '30,40 s/version/story/g' filename              - Replacing words or characters inside a range
sed -i'.orig' 's/this/that/gi' filename             - In-place editing and backing up original file
